`payinvoice_pending`
- dynamic implementation timeout based on client one
- log message when Lighter is locked
- config: added option to change console logging level
- eclair: added `OpenChannel`
- proto: added `amount_received_bits` field to `Invoice` message
- proto: added `balance_confirmed` field to `WalletBalanceResponse` message
- proto: added `CloseChannel` API (full support)

- proto: added `private` field to `Channel` message
- proto: added `state` and `active` fields to `Channel` message

### Changed
- added internal bech32 amount decode to avoid calling the node
(currently lnd's decode doesn't handle amounts below 1 sat)
- added operations to invoices macaroon
- code of conduct
- description of `unimplemented_method` and `unimplemented_parameter` errors
- improved implementation errors mapping
- made `make secure` mandatory
- refactored `Crypter` and `DbHandler`
- cli: increased timeout + log fix
- cli: renamed from `lit-cli` to `cliter`

### Fixed
- minor bugs in `PayInvoice`, `ListChannels`, `OpenChannel`, `ListPeers` and
`GetInfo`
- secure: added keyboard interrupt catching and decryption error handling

### Security
- generation of macaroon rootkey at runtime
- password documentation and auto generation
- using different derived key for each secret
- using `/dev/random` by default to generate password and salts

`INSECURE_CONNECTION` and `MACAROON_DIR`
- add operation logging

### Changed
- Makefile: improved `clean` target (now removes also autogenerated files)
- proto/HopHint: renamed `fee_base_bits` to `fee_base_msat`

### Removed
- config: removed variables `ALLOW_INSECURE_CONNECTION`,
